# 1.5 As an owner of property, I want to be able to charge rent when other players land on my property.
## User Acceptance test Normal Case for charging rent
1. The User lands on a Property square.
2. The system checks if the user owns the property
3. If the user does not own the property and the owner is not null get rent is called to check how many houses if any are on the property
the system then charges according to that amount and displays "The Player: " +currentPlayer.getName() " was charged: " + rent
## User Acceptance Test 2: Error case
- There are no user errors that can be made currently only system errors
