# 1.2 As a player, I want to take turns playing the game.
## User Acceptance Test 1: Normal case
  1. After all users have entered their name with desired game piece, the main game loop will begin
  2. The system will display the current players name and take their turn automatically
  3.  After a player takes their turn, the system will switch to the next player and display their name and take their turn automatically
  4.  The system will display players name is bankrupt if a player becomes bankrupt during their turn
  5.  This cycle will continue until the game is over, which will end when all players except for one are bankrupt. The system will display the player's name has won!! Congrats

## User Acceptance Test 2: Error case
- There are no user errors that can be made currently only system errors
