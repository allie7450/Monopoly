# Monopoly
My project will automate our everyday complex board game that we refer to as Monopoly for students to play with a graphics based java program. Players will be able to choose from eight different game pieces that they will be able to move around the gameboard. To move around the gameboard, the players will roll two six sided dices that will determine the number of spaces the player's game piece can move. Depending on where the game piece lands the player will have to follow the instructions on the space which can consist of chance and community chest cards, jail,free parking, properties, railroads, utilities, and tax. The game of Monopoly will end when all of the players except for one have gone bankrupt.
